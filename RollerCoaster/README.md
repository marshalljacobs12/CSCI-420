# Roller Coaster

### Description: 
In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

### Running the Application:
1. Mac
Navigate to the hw1-starterCode directory in terminal then type the 'make' command. This will generate the executable 'hw1'. To run the program enter type ./hw1 track.txt which begins the simulation.

### Core Credit Features:

- Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher
- Completed levels 1-5
- Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track
- Rendered a Rail Cross Section 
- Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation 
- Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720)
- Understandably written, well commented code
- Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots

### Extra Credit Features:
