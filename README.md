# CSCI-420
Computer Graphics

This repo contains my solutions to the 3 assignments in CSCI 420 Computer Graphics at USC, taught by Professor Jernej Barbic. CSCI 420 covered introductory three-dimensional computer graphics, and assignments were completed using "modern" shader-based OpenGL (core profile). The course website from Spring 2017 is archived here: http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jbarbic/cs420-s17/

A brief description of each assignment is listed below. For more detailed assignment descriptions, see the assignment descriptions in each project's folder.

Assignment 1: Height Fields
--> This assignment required me to create a height field based on the data from an image which the user specifies at the command line, and to allow the user to manipulate the height field in three dimensions by rotating, translating, or scaling it.

Assignment 2: Roller Coaster Simulation
--> In this assignment, I used Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL lighting and texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation. The simulation runs in a first-person view, allowing the user to "ride" the coaster in an immersive environment.

Assignment 3: Ray Tracing
-->  In this assignment, I built a ray tracer that handles opaque surfaces with lighting and shadows. This assignment has minimal amounts of OpenGL (just GLUT for a windowing system) and is implemented using C++.
